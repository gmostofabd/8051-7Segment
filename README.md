## üí° **Basic Discussion on Seven-Segment Display (SSD)**

A **Seven-Segment Display** (SSD) is a simple electronic device used to display decimal numbers and some characters. It consists of 7 LEDs (segments) arranged in a figure-eight pattern, with an additional eighth segment (dot) sometimes used for indicating decimal points.

In this project, a **Common Cathode** SSD is used, where all cathode terminals of the LEDs are tied together and connected to ground. Each segment can be illuminated by applying a HIGH signal (positive voltage) to the corresponding anode.

### **Seven-Segment Layout**:

    |       |
   e|       |c
    |       |
      --d--
</pre>
</div>

Each segment (labeled a to g) is controlled individually to display numbers or specific characters.

In the above diagram:
- Each segment of the SSD is connected to a pin of the microcontroller's Port 2 (P2.0 to P2.7).
- The common cathode is connected to ground.
- Current-limiting resistors are placed between the microcontroller pins and the SSD segments to protect the LEDs from excessive current.

## üìã **ASCII to 7-Segment Encoding Table**

The table below shows how ASCII characters for digits '0' to '9' are mapped to corresponding segments on a seven-segment display. Each segment is represented by a bit, with 1 meaning the segment is on, and 0 meaning the segment is off.

## üõ†Ô∏è **BCD to Seven-Segment Decoder**

A **BCD to Seven-Segment Decoder** is a digital logic circuit that takes a binary-coded decimal (BCD) input and converts it into control signals for a seven-segment display. It maps the BCD values (ranging from 0 to 9) to the corresponding segments needed to display the numbers.

### **How It Works**:
- The BCD input is a 4-bit binary number representing decimal digits 0-9.
- The decoder translates this binary input into a 7-bit output, where each bit corresponds to one of the seven segments of the display (a to g).
- The output bits turn the segments ON or OFF to form the desired digit on the SSD.

For example, a BCD input of `0001` (representing the number '1') will activate segments 'b' and 'c' to display the digit '1' on the seven-segment display.

### **Advantages**:
- Simplifies SSD control in larger projects by reducing the number of GPIO pins required.
- Efficient for driving multiple SSDs in multi-digit displays.

In this project, the SSD control is done manually through assembly code, but in more complex projects, a BCD to Seven-Segment Decoder can be integrated to simplify the control logic.

In summary, this project provides a foundational understanding of SSD interfacing with microcontrollers, focusing on single-digit control using a common cathode configuration. This knowledge will serve as a basis for more advanced projects involving multi-digit displays and more complex decoding techniques.
